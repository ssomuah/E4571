# E4571

This repository contains the projects for E4571 Fall 2017.  

Requirements.txt should have all the required modules used as of Part 1.  
However since all the work is done in a jupyter notebook it's not really used. 
The dataset for part_1 and an ipynb with the project are included in the part_1 folder.  
The part_2 folder has the outline of work for part 2 in another ipynb.
